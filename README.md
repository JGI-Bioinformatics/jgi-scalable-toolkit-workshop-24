# JGI's Scalable Metagenomics Toolbox Workshop

## Date: Oct. 4th Friday

## Venue: JGI User Meeting


Organizers: Satria Kautsar and Zhong Wang  

## Description:

This workshop serves as an introduction to JGI's scalable metagenomics toolbox. Presentations will cover large-scale metagenome assembly using MetaHipMer, metagenome binning with MetaBAT and GenomeFace, and large-scale metagenome protein family detection with HipMCL. We will also introduce a new Apache Spark based scalable genomics library, Axolotl, and demo its usage in large-scale biosynthetic gene cluster discovery. The workshop will also have a hands-on component focused on customized analysis with Axolotl using cloud computing. This workshop is designed for users who are interested in using the JGI scalable tools for customized large-scale data analysis.
